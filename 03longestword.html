<p> Using the PHP language, have the function LongestWord(sen) take the sen parameter being
passed and return the largest word in the string. If there are two or more words that are
the same length, return the first word from the string with that length. Ignore punctuation
and assume sen will not be empty.</p>

<p id="demo">Here is a paragraph</p>
<p id="longword">Goes here:</p>

/*
1. Sentence is split into separate words
2. variable longest holds the current highest number of letters, with 0 as the initial number
3. loop checks the number of letters in each word against variable longest
4. variable word holds the corresponding word that has the same number of letters as variable longest
